## Origin

Pie os was created by a team of 5 in United kingdom, England, Northampton.
The project was led by a team of two: a father and his son. His son, with the newly
layed starting grounds, went on to develop the rest of the project.
Pie os was created using a mix of Python (by Guido Van Rossum) and C (by Dennis Ritchie)
and is currently the most powerful hybrid operating system.
